# The-critics-critique
My hypothesis is: spanish reviewers overrate video games.

## What is this for


## Technologies


## Instructions


### Data

Data was extracted scraping five video game outlets for a total of 15.551 valid reviews. Some texts are 10 years old!



Mean score deviation is the difference between score and prediction in % and looks like this

Â·Positive deviation means sentiment is better than score and vice versa


### Reporting: the dashboard


This dashboard compares how video games critics score a review versus the sentiment said review conveys to the reader according to a pretrained BERT NLP model.


## Conclusions

More than 15,500 review later, this model revealed the truth:

* In 4 out of 5 outlets, human score is frequently better than NLP score
* The better the game, the bigger the score deviation
* Authors make no distinction between platforms

**In conclusion: Spanish reviewers inflate video games scores**

## Special thanks

This project wouldn't been possible without the generous support and assistance of the Ironhack lead and assistante teachers, my pals at Gamereactor and, most importantly, my 24/7 fullstack developer and husband.
